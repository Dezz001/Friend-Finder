# Friend-Finder



I contributed a lot of time into this homework and I believe I navigated the best way I knew how across the bugs and nuances of this application. Please know that it is not complete and I am not totally sure if everything works. Please note the following.

The Home and Survey HTML files ARE NOT MY ORIGINAL WORK, I simply used them as a way to test my application and I had every intention to create my own HTML files but I ran out of time. Therefore, my HTML files are not complete.

My “server.js” file works.

I believe my “htmlRoutes.js” file works.

My “apiRoutes.js” file is what I will call a “Hot Mess!” I am having challenges routing my data through it and I know my absolute value calculation doesn’t work.

My app is not on Heroku.

Lastly, I cannot capture values into the survey HTML and append them to my friend array.


Should you have any questions please do not hesitate to reach out to me.

Thanks
Darrin Davis
