<!-- # Friend-Finder



I contributed a lot of time into this homework and I believe I navigated the best way I knew how across the bugs and nuances of this application. Please know that it is not complete and I am not totally sure if everything works. Please note the following.

The Home and Survey HTML files ARE NOT MY ORIGINAL WORK, I simply used them as a way to test my application and I had every intention to create my own HTML files but I ran out of time. Therefore, my HTML files are not complete.

My “server.js” file works.

I believe my “htmlRoutes.js” file works.

My “apiRoutes.js” file is what I will call a “Hot Mess!” I am having challenges routing my data through it and I know my smallest value absolute value calculation doesn’t work.

Lastly, I cannot capture values into the survey HTML and append them to my friend array.

Should you have any questions please do not hesitate to reach out to me.

Thanks
